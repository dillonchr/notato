# Notato

> \no-tÃ¤-tO\

Hey guys, what is up today I thought I would make a chatbot to notes. There's the short notes thing, I forgot what it's called. The thing where you take molecules of notes. Notion is one app that does this thing supposedly. Idea is to make a post like just chatting with the bot.

And then the record is there by nature of history but also you should be able to query previous labels to find all the notes for a given label. What do you think? It's an improvement on the other thing because you just open a chat with the bot and it's recorded. No trying to figure out how to stich everything together and all the yada yada. Maybe we should plan to do links later? Not sure I care.
